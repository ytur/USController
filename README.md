```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.2
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/ytur/USController.git", from: "1.0.1"),
    ]
)
```
Then run `swift build` whenever you get prepared.

#### Manually 

To use this library in your project manually you may:  

1. for Projects, just drag Source folder to the project tree
2. for Workspaces, include the whole USController.xcodeproj

## Usage
Import USController to the controller which you want to use it as child controller.
```Swift
import USController
```
USController can be configured easily by it's builder initializer methods. You must specify the parent controller with "parentController" parameter of Builder class. Master and Detail controllers can be set with builder methods.
```Swift
let masterController = UIViewController()
let detailController = UIViewController()

let dataSource = USCDataSource.Builder(parentController: self)
                  .setMasterController(masterController, embedInNavController: true)
                  .setDetailController(detailController, embedInNavController: true)
                  .setAppearance(.visibleInit)
                  .setDirection(.trailing)
                  .showBlockerOnMaster(color: .black, opacity: 0.1, allowInteractions: true)
                  .swipeable()
                  .invokeAppearanceMethods()
                  .portraitCustomWidth(100.0)
                  .landscapeCustomWidth(100.0)
                  .visibilityChangesListener(willStartBlock: { (targetVisibility) in
                    print("targetVisibility:\(targetVisibility)")
                  })
                  .build()                  
```

It returns current visibility state of detail controller.
```Swift
dataSource.getCurrentVisibility()
```

It changes current visibility state of detail controller between "visible" and "invisible"
```Swift
dataSource.detailToggle()
```

It removes the USController and its subviews permanently from parent controller and view.
```Swift
dataSource.disposeTheController()
```

Forces the detail controller to hide if it's displayed and keep hidden despite toggle actions.
```Swift
dataSource.forceToHide = true
```
